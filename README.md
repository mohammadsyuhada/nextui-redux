# NextUI Redux

**My vision of how NextUI should be.**
Minimal on the surface. Structured underneath. Built to last.

[NextUI](https://github.com/LoveRetro/NextUI) is a custom firmware for retro handheld gaming devices. It replaces the stock operating system with a clean, minimal interface focused on playing retro games with no unnecessary bloat.

## Supported Devices

- **Trimui Brick**
- **Trimui Smart Pro**
- **Trimui Smart Pro S**

## Why Fork?

NextUI is a great foundation — lightweight, focused, and true to its minimalist roots.

But over time I found myself wanting two things the upstream project couldn't give me:

1. **Creative freedom** — the ability to add features and UX improvements without waiting for upstream approval or aligning with someone else's roadmap.
2. **Structural clarity** — cleaner code organization, consistent formatting, and a codebase that's easier to maintain and extend.

NextUI Redux is where those two goals meet.

This is not a cosmetic fork.
It is a deliberate divergence — feature-driven and structure-focused.

## What's Different

Improvements:

- Refactored `nextui.c` from monolithic code to a smaller, focused components
- Various bug fixes and code optimizations across the refactored components
- Added clang-format tooling and code style enforcement, with VSCode support
- Introduced reusable UI components for consistent design across tools
- Fixed incorrect Wi-Fi/Bluetooth state icons in the quick menu
- Added a semi-transparent progress overlay for all blocking actions
- Added confirmation dialogs for actions that require them
- Rewrote the Settings and Updater app in C with a redesigned UI
- Updated the Battery, Clock, Input app with the redesigned UI 
- Integrated the Remove Loading feature directly into the install script (no separate app required) 

New Features:
- Redesigned UI with consistent styling across the system.
- Game art fallback for titles without save states in the game switcher
- Main menu shortcut for quick access to frequently used Tools/Games
- Direct selection of Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth devices from the quick menu

Upcoming Features:
- Integration with [Netplay](https://github.com/mohammadsyuhada/nextui-netplay)
- Built-in [Music Player](https://github.com/mohammadsyuhada/nextui-music-player)
- Built-in [Video Player](https://github.com/mohammadsyuhada/nextui-video-player)

Ongoing focus areas:

- Cleaner, more maintainable core code
- Improved file and module structure
- Refactoring for readability
- Selective feature improvements as needed
