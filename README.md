# NextUI Redux

**My vision of how NextUI should be.**
Minimal on the surface. Structured underneath. Built to last.

[NextUI](https://github.com/LoveRetro/NextUI) is a custom firmware for retro handheld gaming devices. It replaces the stock operating system with a clean, minimal interface focused on playing retro games with no unnecessary bloat.

## Supported Devices

- **Trimui Brick**
- **Trimui Smart Pro**
- **Trimui Smart Pro S**

## Why Fork?

NextUI is a great foundation — lightweight, focused, and true to its minimalist roots.

But over time I found myself wanting two things the upstream project couldn't give me:

1. **Creative freedom** — the ability to add features and UX improvements without waiting for upstream approval or aligning with someone else's roadmap.
2. **Structural clarity** — cleaner code organization, consistent formatting, and a codebase that's easier to maintain and extend.

NextUI Redux is where those two goals meet.

This is not a cosmetic fork.
It is a deliberate divergence — feature-driven and structure-focused.

## What's Different

Changes shipped in this fork:

- Game art fallback for the game switcher
- Tool/Game shortcut to main menu for faster access

Ongoing focus areas:

- Cleaner, more maintainable core code
- Improved file and module structure
- Refactoring for readability
- Selective feature improvements as needed

## Upstream

This project is a derivative of [LoveRetro/NextUI](https://github.com/LoveRetro/NextUI).

Upstream changes may be merged selectively.
Architectural decisions here prioritize clarity and maintainability over strict parity.
